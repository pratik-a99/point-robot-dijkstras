Path Planning for Point Robot using Dijkstra's Algorithm 

Libraries Used:
* Numpy
* OpenCV
* heapq
* math

Instructions:
1. To run the file in Ubuntu, open a terminal and enter `python Dijkstra-pathplanning-Pratik-Acharya.py` or `python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-Pratik-Acharya.py`.
2. Use input the start and goal positions in the terminal
3. The output will be shown on the terminal and a screen will pop up showing the algorithm working.

The code can also be run in any IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code

Testing:
1. Input can be provided in the terminal/command line as start and goal positions to desired coordinates.
2. The video saving code is commented and can be enabled by uncommenting lines 21-24, 345, 358 and 363.
